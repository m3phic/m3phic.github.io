title: Causal Experimental Design 
bio: "<p>Stefan Bauer is a professor at TU Munich, group leader at Helmholtz Institute Munich and a CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar. Using and developing tools of causality, deep learning and real robotic systems, his research focuses on the longstanding goal of artificial intelligence to design machines that can extrapolate experience across environments and tasks. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich and was awarded with the ETH medal for an outstanding doctoral thesis. Before that, he graduated with a BSc and MSc in Mathematics from ETH Zurich and a BSc in Economics and Finance from the University of London. During his studies, he held scholarships from the Swiss and German National Merit Foundation. In 2019, he won the best paper award at the International Conference of Machine Learning (ICML) and in 2020, he was the lead organizer of the real-robot-challenge.com, a robotics challenge in the cloud.</p>"
abstract: "Deep neural networks have achieved outstanding success in many tasks ranging from computer vision, to natural language processing, and robotics. However such models still pale in their ability to understand the world around us, as well as generalizing and adapting to new tasks or environments. One possible solution to this problem are causal models, since they can reason about the connections between causal variables and the effect of intervening on them. This talk will introduce the fundamental  concepts of causal inference, connections and synergies with deep learning  as well as practical applications and advances in sustainability and AI for science.
