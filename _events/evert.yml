title: AI for Quantum Experiments 
bio: Evert is a theoretical condensed matter physicist with a background in open systems, numerical simulations and many-body effects. He now also actively works on investigating how both condensed matter physics and machine learning can help each other.
abstract:  In this talk I aim to showcase how machine learning inspired optimisations can help with current state-of-the-art experiments. In particular, I will first consider the readout of semiconductor spin qubits using simple principal component analysis. I will then highlight a specifically fabricated semiconductor device with a 3x3 ‘pixel array’, and discuss the simultaneous tuning of those 9 gate voltages to construct a quantum point contact. And finally, I will move on to larger arrays of quantum dots and the detection of transitions between charge states (i.e. finding the facets of high-dimensional coulomb diamonds).
