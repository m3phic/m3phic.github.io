title: 'Artificial Chemical Intelligence: Integrated Theory, Simulations and AI for Enabling Molecular Discovery'
bio: Pratyush Tiwary is an Associate Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Physical Science and Technology. He received his undergraduate degree in Metallurgical Engineering from IIT-BHU, PhD in Materials Science from Caltech followed by postdoctoral work at ETH Zurich and Columbia University. His work at the interface of molecular simulations, statistical mechanics and machine learning has been recognized through many awards including Sloan Research Fellowship in Chemistry, NSF CAREER award, NIH Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award and ACS OpenEye Outstanding Junior Faculty Award. 
abstract: "The universality of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics has led to a language comprehensible to chemists, physicists, materials scientists, geologists & others, enabling countless scientific discoveries in diverse fields. In the last decade, a new arguably common language that everyone seems to speak but no one quite fully understands, has emerged with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). It is natural to ask if AI can be integrated with the various theoretical and simulation methods rooted in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics for discoveries that none of these could achieve individually. It is also natural to ask if chemists, who are not fundamentally trained in AI, should trust any of the results obtained using AI or even worse, theory or computer simulations that were guided by AI. In this seminar I will show how such an integration of disciplines can be attained, creating trustable, robust AI frameworks for use by chemists and physical scientists. I will talk about such methods developed by my group using and extending different flavors of AI [1-3]. I will demonstrate the methods on different problems involving protein kinases, riboswitches and amino acid nucleation [4-5], where we predict mechanisms at timescales much longer than milliseconds while keeping all-atom/femtosecond resolution, including the problem of recovering a Boltzmann weighted ensemble of conformations from AlphaFold2 [6]. I will conclude with an outlook for future challenges and opportunities, envisioning a new sub-discipline of “Artificial Chemical Intelligence” where chemistry (both theory and simulations) move hand-in-hand with AI to enable smart molecular discovery.<br>
