speaker: "Raquel Rodriguez Perez (Novartis)"
title: "Can machine learning replace ADME experiments in drug discovery?"
bio: "Dr. Raquel Rodríguez-Pérez is a Principal Scientist at Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research and works in the Modeling & Simulation Data Science team in the Translational Medicine Department. She develops machine learning models to predict compound properties relevant in pharmacokinetics. She supports drug discovery teams with modeling and data science tools in order to make better and faster decision in lead optimization.
Prior to working at Novartis, Raquel obtained her B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Barcelona and her PhD in Computational Life Sciences from the University of Bonn. She worked on data analysis for bioinformatics applications at the Institute for BioEngineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and did her thesis about machine learning models for interpretable compound activity predictions. Therefore, she has experience with the application of machine learning and deep learning methods in different life sciences problems. She was a Marie Curie fellow and worked at the Computational Chemistry - Data Science group in Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany. She has acted as a mentor of scientists at different careers levels both in academia and industry. Overall, her research interests include bio/cheminformatics, machine learning, and data science for biomedical applications."
abstract: "Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties play an important role in the success of drug candidates. Unfavorable pharmacokinetics (PK) can prevent that compounds progress in drug development and early ADME/PK properties' screening aims at reducing the number of molecules failing in the development process. This talk will focus on how to use machine learning to leverage historical ADME/PK data and make predictions for new compounds. Machine learning models developed for PK property predictions will be presented, as well as some of their applications at NIBR. Such models are applicable to large libraries, virtual compounds, and generative chemistry workflows. Hence, predictions enable early informed decisions and compound prioritization, aiming at reducing late-stage attrition. However, using machine learning-based predictions to support decision-making in a drug discovery project involves important considerations. Current challenges and future directions for improving the use of ADMET models in industry will be discussed."
