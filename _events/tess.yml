title: Unexpected Lessons from Neural Networks Built with Symmetry for Physical Systems
bio: Tess Smidt is an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. Tess earned her SB in Physics from MIT in 2012 and her PhD in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2018. Her research focuses on machine learning that incorporates physical and geometric constraints, with applications to materials design. Prior to joining the MIT EECS faculty, she was the 2018 Alvarez Postdoctoral Fellow in Computing Sciences at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a Software Engineering Intern on the Google Accelerated Sciences team where she developed Euclidean symmetry equivariant neural networks which naturally handle 3D geometry and geometric tensor data.
abstract: Atomic systems (molecules, crystals, proteins, etc.) are naturally represented by a set of coordinates in 3D space labeled by atom type. This is a challenging representation to use for machine learning because the coordinates are sensitive to 3D rotations, translations, and inversions (the symmetries of 3D Euclidean space). In this talk I’ll give an overview of Euclidean invariance and equivariance in machine learning for atomic systems. Then, I’ll share some recent applications of these methods on a variety of atomistic modeling tasks (ab initio molecular dynamics, prediction of crystal properties, and scaling of electron density predictions). Finally, I’ll explore open questions in expressivity, data-efficiency, and trainability of methods leveraging invariance and equivariance.
