description: We are a research group focusing on Aritificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Natural Sciences (AIMLeNS), based at the <a href="http://dsai.se/">Data Science and AI division</a> of the Computer Science and Engineering department at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. <br> In the AIMLeNS we are interested in problems at the interface of the natural sciences, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Currently, we are especially interested in the following problems<br> <ol>  <li>Multi-modal machine learning for protein dynamics</li>  <li>Molecular property prediction </li> <li>Surrogate models for molecular dynamics and inverse design </li> <li> Equivariant neural networks for molecular applications </li> <li>Control of near-term quantum devices.</li></ol> <br> We are currently hiring <b>2</b> postdocs in <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/work-with-us/vacancies/?rmpage=job&rmjob=11430&rmlang=UK">Anti-venom design</a> and <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/work-with-us/vacancies/?rmpage=job&rmjob=11433&rmlang=UK">AI-driven optimization of variational algorithms for near-term quantum computers</a>  <br><br>We are generously funded by <br><a href="https://wasp-sweden.org"><img src="https://wasp-sweden.org/wp-content/themes/wasp/assets/img/logo.png"></a><a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/wacqt/"><img src="https://psolsson.github.io/assets/img/wacqt.png"></a>
