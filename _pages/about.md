description: We are a research group focusing on Aritificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Natural Sciences (AIMLeNS), based at the <a href="http://dsai.se/">Data Science and AI division</a> of the Computer Science and Engineering department at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. <br> In the AIMLeNS we are interested in problems at the interface of the natural sciences, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Currently, we are especially interested in the following problems<br> <ol>  <li>Generative models for molecular design</li>  <li>Representation learning for molecular systems </li> <li>Effective algorithms for molecular dynamics </li> <li> Data integration for Structural Biology </li> <li>Control of near-term quantum devices.</li></ol><br><br><h2>Current Vacancies:</h2><a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/Working-at-Chalmers/Vacancies/Pages/default.aspx?rmpage=job&rmjob=10182&rmlang=UK">Open Postdoc position (2 years) in collaboration with Pernilla Wittung-Stafhede on Machine Learning for Metallo-protein biophysics</a> <br><br>We are generously funded by <br><a href="https://wasp-sweden.org"><img src="https://wasp-sweden.org/wp-content/themes/wasp/assets/img/logo.png"></a>
