description: We are a research group focusing on Aritificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Natural Sciences (AIMLeNS), based at the <a href="http://dsai.se/">Data Science and AI division</a> of the Computer Science and Engineering department at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. <br> In the AIMLeNS we are interested in problems at the interface of the natural sciences, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Currently, we are especially interested in the following problems<br> <ol>  <li>Multi-modal machine learning for protein dynamics</li>  <li>Molecular property prediction </li> <li>Surrogate models for molecular dynamics and inverse design </li> <li> Equivariant neural networks for molecular applications </li> <li>Control of near-term quantum devices.</li></ol>
